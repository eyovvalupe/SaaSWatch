## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:** React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool

**UI Component System:** shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives) with a Linear-inspired design system
- Chosen for: Enterprise-grade polish, accessibility, and comprehensive component library
- Design philosophy: Information-dense dashboard with clarity over decoration
- Styling: TailwindCSS with custom design tokens for consistent theming
- Theme support: Dark mode primary, light mode secondary via ThemeProvider context

**State Management:**
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state and data fetching
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form handling
- React Context for theme and sidebar state management

**Routing:** Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- Chosen over React Router for: Smaller bundle size, simpler API for SPA needs

**Data Visualization:** Recharts library for spending trends and analytics charts

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript
- RESTful API design pattern
- Middleware-based request processing
- Centralized error handling

**API Structure:**
- Resource-based endpoints (`/api/applications`, `/api/licenses`, `/api/renewals`, etc.)
- CRUD operations with validation using Zod schemas
- JSON request/response format
- Logging middleware for API request tracking

**Current Storage:** In-memory storage (MemStorage class) - ACTIVE
- Implements IStorage interface for easy database migration
- UUID-based entity identifiers
- Support for: Applications, Licenses, Renewals, Recommendations, Spending History, Conversations, Messages
- Auto-seeded with sample data on server startup

**Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket Server
- Protocol: ws:// on /ws path (separate from Vite HMR WebSocket)
- Purpose: Real-time message delivery for Team Chat and Vendor CRM
- Broadcasting: Messages sent to all connected clients for live updates
- Integration: Works alongside Express REST API

**Planned Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Configuration exists in `drizzle.config.ts` for future migration
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle's pg-core
- Schema includes: Foreign key relationships, timestamps, decimal precision for financial data

### Data Schema Design

**Core Entities:**

1. **Applications** - Central entity tracking SaaS apps
   - Status types: approved, shadow, trial
   - Financial tracking: monthly cost, logo/branding assets
   - Categories for organization

2. **Licenses** - Per-application license management
   - Active vs. total license tracking for utilization metrics
   - Cost per license for granular spend analysis
   - Cascade delete on application removal

3. **Renewals** - Contract renewal scheduling
   - Renewal date tracking with auto-renew flags
   - Annual cost and contract value separation
   - Notification status tracking

4. **Recommendations** - Action items and optimization suggestions
   - Types: downgrade, renew, track-users, review-renewal, cost-review
   - Priority levels: high, medium, low
   - Potential savings calculations with before/after costs

5. **Spending History** - Time-series financial data
   - Monthly aggregation for trend analysis
   - Supports chart visualization

6. **Conversations** - Communication threads for collaboration and CRM
   - Types: internal (team chat), vendor (CRM)
   - Linked to specific applications
   - Supports both team collaboration and vendor negotiations

7. **Messages** - Individual messages within conversations
   - Sender identification (name and role)
   - Message types: text, system
   - Timestamps for chronological ordering
   - Real-time delivery via WebSocket

**Design Rationale:**
- Normalized schema prevents data duplication
- Decimal types for financial accuracy (avoiding floating-point issues)
- Timestamps for audit trails and historical analysis
- Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- Conversation types enable dual-purpose messaging (internal + external)

### External Dependencies

**Database (Planned):**
- **Neon Database** (@neondatabase/serverless) - Serverless PostgreSQL
  - Rationale: Serverless architecture matches deployment model, zero-config scaling
  - Connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

**UI Component Libraries:**
- **Radix UI** - Unstyled, accessible component primitives
  - Components: Dialog, Dropdown, Popover, Tooltip, Accordion, and 20+ others
  - Chosen for: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Form & Validation:**
- **React Hook Form** - Form state management
- **Zod** - Runtime type validation and schema parsing
- **@hookform/resolvers** - Integration layer between RHF and Zod
- **drizzle-zod** - Auto-generate Zod schemas from Drizzle tables

**Data Visualization:**
- **Recharts** - Chart library for spending trends
  - Rationale: React-native components, composable API, responsive by default

**Real-Time Communication:**
- **WebSocket (ws)** - Native browser WebSocket API for real-time messaging
  - Server: Node.js `ws` library integrated with Express server
  - Client: Browser WebSocket API for bidirectional communication
  - Use case: Live message delivery in Team Chat and Vendor CRM

**Utilities:**
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation and formatting (chosen over Moment.js for tree-shaking)
- **clsx** + **tailwind-merge** - Conditional className composition
- **class-variance-authority** - Type-safe variant management for components

**Development Tools:**
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** - Type safety across full stack
- **ESBuild** - Production bundling for server code
- **PostCSS + Autoprefixer** - CSS processing

**Fonts:**
- **Inter** - Primary typeface (via Google Fonts) for UI text
- **JetBrains Mono** - Monospace font for data tables and metrics

**Session Management (Configured):**
- **connect-pg-simple** - PostgreSQL session store for Express
  - Ready for implementation when user authentication is added

### Build & Deployment

**Development:**
- `npm run dev` - Concurrent Vite dev server + Express API with HMR
- Vite middleware mode for seamless frontend/backend integration
- Source maps enabled for debugging

**Production:**
- `npm run build` - Vite builds client assets, ESBuild bundles server
- Static assets served from `dist/public`
- Single Node.js process serves both API and static files

**Environment Variables:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (required for Drizzle operations)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment flag (development/production)
